== Description ==

= Who this is for =

This plugin is intended for a very specific audience. If you are *not* one of the below then this plugin will not be useful to you.

* Users of [official themes](http://churchthemes.com) from churchthemes.com
* Users of [third-party themes](http://churchthemes.guide) from other providers made *specifically* for this plugin
* Theme developers wanting to improve data portability for church sites

= What it does =

It enables users to manage *sermons*, *events*, *people* and *locations* to be displayed by a compatible theme.

Experienced WordPress developers agree that functionality like this does not belong in themes since themes are intended only for controlling the appearance of a WordPress site. Content that users might expect to take with them if they switch themes should "live" in a plugin in order to [avoid theme lock-in](http://churchthemes.com/2014/05/27/wordpress-theme-users-avoid-lock-in-effect/). Similarly, our approach is not to present content using the plugin since themes offer more control for that purpose. This is why a **compatible theme is required**.

See the [Plugin Details](http://churchthemes.com/plugins/church-theme-content/) on churchthemes.com for a tour of features. Read the [User Guide](http://churchthemes.com/guides/user/plugins/church-theme-content/) for instructions.
