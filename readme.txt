== Description ==

= Who this is for =

This plugin is intended for a very specific audience. If you are *not* one of the below then this plugin will not be useful to you.

* Users of themes made by [churchthemes.com](http://churchthemes.com)
* Users of themes from other providers made *specifically* for use with this plugin
* Theme developers wanting to improve data portability among church WordPress sites

= What it does =

It enables users to manage *sermons*, *events*, *people* and *locations* to be displayed by a compatible theme.

Experienced WordPress developers agree that functionality like this does not belong in themes since themes are intended only for controlling the appearance of a WordPress site. Content that users might expect to take with them if they switch themes should "live" in a plugin in order to [avoid theme lock-in](http://churchthemes.com/2014/05/27/wordpress-theme-users-avoid-lock-in-effect/). Similarly, our approach is not to present content using the plugin since themes offer more control for that purpose. This is why a **compatible theme is required**.

See the plugin's page on churchthemes.com for a [tour of features](http://churchthemes.com/plugins/church-theme-content/).

= Add-ons =
